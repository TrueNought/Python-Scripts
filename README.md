# Python-Scripts
A compilation of miscellaneous Python scripts that I've made to help with various tasks.

## qoobee_gif_scraper
Wanted to download GIF stickers from a website without having to manually scroll through each blog post. 
Used Selenium to automate scrolling through an infinite scroll page and BeautifulSoup4 to parse HTML content to find the source URLs for each GIF.
